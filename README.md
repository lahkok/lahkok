- Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Irfan, I am an enthusiastic beginner in the world of back-end web development. I am currently building a strong foundation in programming languages like PHP or Node.js and grasping the fundamental principles of server creation, database management, and web application development. I possess problem-solving skills, an understanding of server requests, and the ability to design efficient back-end solutions.

- I am also in the process of learning web security concepts, API development, and database integration to ensure that the applications I build are secure and performant.
